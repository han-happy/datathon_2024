Files   

* melissa_data_eda.ipynb == the main notebook that has the visuals of the maps
* grocery_eda_copy.ipynb == used to combine grocery info (with census tract data) with track zip (census tract and zipcode convert) 
    * this was exported to a new csv called grocery_zip.csv

everything else is miscellaneous files, either data or trial/error coding
